            <h1><u>About</u></h1>
            <p>Hey! I’m a solo developer with a passion for learning and creating. My journey into C++ began when I joined a project aimed at helping kids in underprivileged areas discover technology. That’s where I encountered Arduino for the first time—and from there, I had to dive into C++. We also study it in school, so it became a key part of my path.</p>

            <p>What really inspired me was how others taught me with patience and passion. That lit something in me. I believe in passing on what we’re given, and for me, this is also something Jesus taught us—to help and guide others. That’s why I created this site: to teach others C++ while I continue to learn and grow myself.</p>

            <p>One of my biggest dreams is to create a game—just one, even if it’s simple—that tells my story through every part of it. I want it to mean something. I’m working on other projects too, though things are complicated at the moment and it can be hard to keep up. Still, I keep moving forward, learning piece by piece.</p>

            <p>This site is just the beginning. I plan to share open-source projects, lessons on C++, maybe even English resources—since school doesn’t always cover everything—and whatever else might help others who are also learning.</p>

            <p>Most of what I know, I’ve picked up by teaching myself. The project I joined gave me a start, but it was far from enough. Now I learn as I go—right now I’m digging into HTML and JavaScript to build this very site, while continuing with C++ exercises for school.</p>

            <p>If you ever want to connect, ask questions, or just follow what I’m working on, you can reach me on GitHub. I’m still getting the hang of the platform, but it’ll work :)</p>

            <p>Thanks for being here—and keep learning.</p>
