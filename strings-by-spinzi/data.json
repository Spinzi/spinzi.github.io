Long before the modern <code>std::string</code> existed, programmers used <b>char arrays</b> to store text. And because of something called <b>Backward Compatibility</b>, modern C++ still lets us use many string functions on these old char arrays.",

I’ll explain everything in a simple and friendly way, but you should already know a little bit of C++ basics — things like variables, arrays, <span class=\"inline-code\">#include</span>, and <span class=\"inline-code\">std::cout</span>. Don’t worry, I won’t throw anything impossible at you, but this isn’t meant for total beginners either."
